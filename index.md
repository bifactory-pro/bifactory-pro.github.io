BIFactory is a tool for defining a semantic layer using a domain-specific language, enabling the automatic generation of both ETL processes and the Power BI semantic model.

With centralized code management, BIFactory eliminates redundancy by ensuring changes are made in a single location, automatically propagating updates across the ETL and semantic layer. This approach enhances consistency, maintains business-friendly naming, and handles relationships automatically, streamlining the entire BI development process.
